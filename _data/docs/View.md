Tellin.js uses [Ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/getting_started.html "ejs") as the template. You can find some more detail about Ejs from its website.

# Where to put template files

You can put the template folder in the folder '_view'. 

Also you can change the default root folder in tellin.config ('_Path_ViewFolder').

# Ejs controls

Here is a part of tellin.json.

```
//...
"filename":"./_view/controls",
//..
```

The filename is required by ejs.js. You can put your ejs controllers there.
